## Source code for the analyses

We describe what each script (`.Rmd`) of this repository is intended to achieve below.

- _01_selecting-ebird-data.Rmd:_. In this script, we pre-processing citizen science data from [eBird](https://ebird.org/home) and finalized a list of species for downstream processing (this list can be modified based on the requirements you have for your study). For our study, we manually removed raptors _Accipitriformes_ and _Falconidae_, swifts _Apodiformes_, and swallows _Hirundinidae_, since the observations of these birds are generally made when they are in flight and can be prone to errors. We considered only terrestrial birds and largely passerine species, and removed many species that are often easily confused for their congeners (eg. green/greenish warbler). Our filtering process resulted in a total of 1.29 million observations (presences) between 2013 to 2021 across 79 terrestrial, diurnal birds found in our study area (list of species can be found in the `data/` folder).

- _02_prep-ebird-data.Rmd:_. In this script, we processed the [eBird](https://ebird.org/home) by applying a number of filters. These filters included spatial, sampling, and temporal filters. For example, we added a sampling effort based filter following (Johnston et al. 2019), wherein we considered only those checklists with duration in minutes less than 300 and distance in kilometers traveled is less than 5km. We excluded those group checklists where the number of observers was greater than 10. For the sake of occupancy modeling of appropriate detection and occupancy covariates, we restricted all our checklists between December 1st and May 31st (non-rainy months)and checklists recorded between 5am and 7pm (Please vary this step based on your question, study area and list of species).

- _03_prep-environmental-predictors.Rmd:_. Here, we processed climatic and landscape predictors across our study area. The shell script `bash/get_chelsa.sh` is used to get selected CHELSA rasters, which are listed in `data/chelsa/envidatS3paths.txt`. These were used to calculate the layers BIOCLIM 4a and 15a, for temperature seasonality and precipitation seasonality, respectively. A land cover layer was reclassified to 7 classes; all layers were then resampled to 1km resolution.

- _04_checklist-calibration-index.Rmd:_. Differences in local avifaunal expertise among citizen scientists can lead to biased species detection when compared with data collected by a consistent set of trained observers (Van Strien et al. 2013). Including observer expertise as a detection covariate in occupancy models using eBird data can help account for this variation (Johnston et al. 2018). We calculated observer-specific expertise scores (later used to assign a Checklist Calibration Index) across all unique observers within our study area for the time-period 2013 to 2021. 

- _05_distance-roads-neighbours.ipynb_: This Python script is used to determine how far each checklist location is from the nearest road, and how far each site is from its nearest neighbour. We used Python to take advantage of `scipy` cKDtrees for spatial computation.   

- _06_spatial-sampling-bias-distRoads.Rmd_: Here, we visualized spatial clustering in checklists, in relation to roads and to other checklists.

- _07_temporal-sampling.Rmd_: Here, we visualized temporal clustering in checklists.

- _08_final-covar-data.Rmd_: In this script, we prepared a final covariate dataframe consisting of detection level covariates and occupancy level covariates.

- _09_occupancy-models.Rmd_: Here, we run occupancy models across climatic and landscape covariates. In addition, we run goodness-of-fit tests.     

- _10_visualize-occu-predictor-effects.Rmd_: We visualized the magnitude and direction of species-specific probabilities of occupancy.  

- _11_predict-probOfOccupancy.Rmd_: We plot species-specific probabilities of occupancy as a function of significant environmental predictors and mapped occupancy across the study area for a given list of species and significant predictors.  

Methods and format are derived from [Strimas-Mackey et al.](https://cornelllabofornithology.github.io/ebird-best-practices/), the supplement to [Johnston et al. 2021)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/ddi.13271).

## Data 

The `data/` folder contains the following datasets required to reproduce the above scripts.  

### eBird data

Please download the eBird sampling and EBD dataset from https://ebird.org/home prior to running the above code. 

### Species specific data

- `species_list.csv`: Contains a list of species that was analyzed in this study.  

- `species-trait-dat.csv`: Contains selected columns of species trait data which was downloaded from Sheard et al. (2020).   

### Climate data

All climate is housed in the `chelsa/` folder within `data/`. In this folder, you will find processed `.tif` files corresponding to temperature seasonality (bio4a) and precipitation seasonality (bio15).  

### Spatial data

All spatial data is house in two folders `spatial/` and `landUseClassification/` within the `data/` folder. The `spatial/` folder contains shapefiles corresponding to the outline of our study area (the Nilgiris and the Anamalai hills), an Open Street Map Roads shapefile and an elevation raster (obtained from SRTM). The `landUseClassification/` folder contains a raster of land cover classes (source: Roy et al. 2015) and a `.csv` corresponding to a reclassification matrix.
